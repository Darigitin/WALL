            <H1>The Journey to (THE) WALL</H1>
            <p>
                There was a time when WALL was just the mad ravings of a professor.<br>
                But he was determined, and so, to bring his idea to fruition, 
                he found his means.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>A Beginning - The GMS Chronicles</h2>
            <p>
                A long time ago (2010, if you want the specifics), in a different 
                building than this ("this", being the Engineering and Computer Science
                Building at WTAMU), a team was formed.<br>
                The team was assigned to work - no, Create - an Assembly Language, and a
                Machine Simulator to go with it. Through hard-work, dedication -
                lots and lots of tears - they created WALL 0.1.<br>
                Back in the day, they decided to call him by another name - GMS.
                GMS stood for Google Machine Simulator. Ask not me, why. Only the
                mind of the mad could understand their reasons.<br>
                With somewhere in the neighborhood of 23 Operations, and 4 Pseudo-Ops,
                GMS was a good start.<br>
                The idea at the time was for GMS to be platform independent, and so
                he was made to be a Web-Application.<br> 
                <img src="images/GMS Machine.png" alt="GMS Machine" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/>
                <img src="images/GMS Editor.png" alt="GMS Editor" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/> <br>
                It was a good attempt, but left something to be desired. So, Let's 
                move through time, to a distant future, (2013-ish, perhaps),
                and see what GMS will become.
            </p>
            <h2>The Fledgling - Am I Still GMS?</h2>
            <p>
                GMS was never really alone. Year after year he saw team after team -
                the purpose? Domination (Growth in reality, but that sounds less
                daunting). He was reaching his teens (in Computer years), but still
                he was never quite... himself. At this point, the idea of GMS being a
                Web-App seemed less ideal, not for a lack to opportunity or scalability,
                but because he had been bogged down in years of patches, tinkering,
                and hormonal growth. So, where to go from here?<br>
                At this point, there was an idea - that GMS could still remain platform
                independent, but without being a Web-App. The idea brought intrigue,
                and so, a decision made - GMS was to become a Java Application
                (living and breathing - in a jar).<br>
                GMS was a great concept in his early days, but he suffered from 
                some unfortunate issues. He lacked line numbers in his editor 
                (despite telling the user what line an error was on). The editor
                and Machine were light years apart. He lacked scalability. But he was
                loved (except by the freshman) for his flaws.<br>
                Now, you ask? Well, the proof is in the pudding (chocolate, so you
                know).<br>
                <img src="images/GMS 1.0.png" alt="GMS 1.0" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/> <br>
                HE LIVES (in an improved User Interface)!
                With this change in pace, GMS was reborn into a more effective interface.
                Even as the whole world opened up to him, he still had many things
                to work on. GMS still had many minor bugs that had yet to be discovered,
                and some things that seemed an improvement, were not really all there.<br>
                At this point GMS was still unable to scale, some Operations did
                not work properly under certain circumstances. Needless to say, he was
                not perfect (yet!).

            <h2>The WALL - A Journey Must End, For Another To Begin</h2>
            <p>
                Here we are. Today (May 2016, for you future-kins).<br>
                A short back-story here. WALL was named by an individual on team Atop the WALL
                (picture annoying and infuriating, and that's him). WALL stands for
                WTAMU AssembLy Language. The reason for this, because at WTAMU it is
                considered the last hurtle a student needs to make before they are
                officially a CS major.<br>
                And now, we return to today. WALL has matured into a reasonable 20-something 
                ("reasonable"). The latest round of development saw a full rewrite of how WALL's
                interface worked, how it handled some errors, and a slew of bug fixes
                and error handling.<br>
                Now, with no more Sweet talk. Say hello... to WALL.<br>
                <img src="images/WALL 1.6.png" alt="WALL 1.6"/> <br>
                From sleek and shiny scalability, to enhanced Editor capabilites,
                27 Operations and 5 Pseudo-Ops, robust error handling and Machine Interface. 
                WALL has become quit the impressive little learning tool. But he is not done. 
                Nay, no code is ever done. So, from here on out, it is a journey to becoming 
                a better Product, and better Teacher - a better Friend.
