            <h1>WALL (WTAMU AssembLy Language) Syntax</h1>
            <p>When you climb me, you will be a CS major.<br>
               But, be forewarned you will be driven into me, and many will go mad.

            <h2>WALL Syntax Structure</h2>
            <p>
                [label:] [instruction] [# comment]
            </p>
            <p>
                The above line is the syntactical structure for every line of code
                written in WALL.<br>
                Note: The brackets denote that the content is optional.
                Even though each portion is optional, the order is not.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A line begins with an optional label, that is delimited by a colon.<br>
                    Note: Labels ARE case sensitive.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The next part of the line is an Operation or Pseudo-Op,followed by
                    its arguments.<br>
                    Note: Instructions and arguments are NOT case sensitive.<br>                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally a line can end in an optional comment. (Anything that comes
                    after the comment symbol "#" is treated as a comment, even labels and
                    instructions.)<br>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Reserved Characters and Words</h2>
            <p> These are characters and words that are used by WALL to Parse and interpret
                the code input into the Text Editor. Therefore using them as a label or a
                EQU label may cause unpredictable errors in the Assembler.
            <ol>
                <li>Commas(,) - to deliminate arguments</li>
                <li>Quotations("") - used by DB to input strings into memory</li>
                <li>Apostrophes('') - used by DB to input strings into memory</li>
                <li>Mathematic Operators(= &lt;) - used by JMP operations</li>
                <li>Register Names(R0-RF) - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
                <li>Operation Names - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
                <li>Pseudo-Op Names - overloading these names can confuse the parser</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>WALL has 16 Registers.</h2>
            <p>
                Registers are used as a form of "lag free" memory to store data 
                temporarily as it is being manipulated.<br> 
                Most of these are general purpose, and have no special uses, but
                the following have special purposes.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Operations</h2>
            <p>
                Operations are Instructions and their arguments. Each instruction
                has its own specific argument structure. All instructions compile
                into their Op-Code format and are stored into memory for execution.
                Note: All Instructions, except for RLOAD, are 2 Bytes long.
                RLOAD is 4 Bytes long, because it compiles as an immediate load,
                followed by itself.<br>
            </p>
            <table>
                <tbody>

            <h2>Pseudo-Ops</h2>
            <p>
                Pseudo-Ops are similar to Operations, except that they do not compile
                as code directly into memory. Instead, they act as a kind of marker
                that tell the Assembler how to handle some kinds of associations and data.<br>
