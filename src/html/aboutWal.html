            <H1>The Journey to (a) WALL</H1>
            <p>
                There was a time when WALL was just the mad ravings of a professor.<br>
                So, to bring his idea to fruition, he found his means.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>A Beginning - The GMS Chronicles</h2>
            <p>
                A long time ago (2010, if you want the specifics), in a different 
                building than this ("this", being the Engineering and Computer Science
                Building at WTAMU), a team was formed.<br>
                The team was assigned to work - No - Create an Assembly Language and a
                Machine Simulator to go with it. Through hard-work, dedication -
                lots and lots of tears - they created WALL 0.1.<br>
                Back in the day, they decided to call him by another name - GMS.
                GMS stood for Google Machine Simulator. Ask not me, why. Only the
                mind of the mad could understand their reasons.<br>
                With somewhere in the neighborhood of 23 Operations, and 4 Pseudo-Ops,
                GMS was a good start.<br>
                The idea at the time was for GMS to be platform independent, and so
                he was made to be a Web-Application.<br> 
                <img src="images/GMS Machine.png" alt="GMS Machine" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/>
                <img src="images/GMS Editor.png" alt="GMS Editor" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/> <br>
                It was a good attempt, but left something to be desired. So, Let's 
                move through time, to a distant future, (2013-ish, perhaps),
                and see what GMS will become.
            </p>
            <h2>The Fledgling - Am I Still GMS?</h2>
            <p>
                GMS was never really alone. Year after year he saw team after team -
                the purpose? Domination (Growth in reality, but that sounds less
                daunting). He was reaching his teens (in Computer years), but still
                he was never quit... himself. At this point, the idea of GMS being a
                Web-App seemed less ideal, not for a lack to opportunity or scalability,
                but because he had been bogged down in years of patches, tinkering,
                and hormonal growth. So, where to go from here?<br>
                At this point, there was an idea - that GMS could still remain platform
                independent, but without being a Web-App. The idea brought intrigue,
                and so, a decision made - GMS was to become a Java Application
                (living and breathing - in a jar).<br>
                GMS was a great concept in his early days, but he suffered from 
                some unfortunate issues. He lacked line numbers in his editor 
                (despite telling the user what line an error was on). The editor
                and Machine were light years apart. He lacked scalability. But he was
                loved (except by the freshman) for his flaws.<br>
                Now, you ask? Well, the proof is in the pudding (chocolate, so you
                know).

                HE LIVES (in an improved User Interface)!
