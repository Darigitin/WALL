            <p>All operations are compiled into 2 bytes of data with the 
                exception of RLOAD which is compiled into 4 bytes.  Once compiled the operation 
                is specified by the first 4 bits and in some cases the entire 
                first byte.  The remainder of the bits are used to store arguments.
