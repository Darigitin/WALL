            <h1>How to write Loop Structures in WALL</h1>
            <p>
                Just like in High-Level Languages, WALL and any other Assemblers
                are capable of looping over a section of code until a condition is
                met.<br>
                The following two examples of how a user would write a While loop 
                and a do While loop in WALL.
            </p>
            <pre>
                # Sum of the first 10 numbers
                # R0 is 11 since we terminate on equality.
                # If R0 was 10, we'd get the sum of the first 9 numbers.
                        org 0x00
                main:   load R0,11          # Termination Condition
                        load R1,1           # Constant 1
                        xor  R2,R2,R2       # Load R2 with 0
                        xor  RA,RA,RA       # Load RA with 0
                        jmp  while

                while:  jmpeq R2=R0,done    # while R2 != 0
                        add   RA,RA,R2      #   Sum = Sum + number
                        add   R2,R2,R1      #   number = number + 1
                        jmp   while

            <h1>How to Iterate through an Array</h1>
            <p>
                In High-Level Languages, to get to each value in an array you need
                to iterate through each index of the array. WALL is no different.<br>
                There are two ways to create arrays in WALL; with the DB and the BSS
                pseudo-ops.<br>
                DB  - will "initialize" an array with values.<br>
                BSS - will "reserve" X amount of memory (no need to "initialize").<br>
                Note: DB is special, in that it allows you to create a String of
                characters using quotation marks ("") or apostrophes (''). What DB
                does in these cases, is assign each character to an address (sequentially).
                So, that means each character is at a different "index" of the array.<br>
                <br>
                There are two things to note in the Code below.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The output of both loops is the same, since they both look for
                    the same terminating condition (a null character). This is a
                    common way to end a string (all Strings in C are null character
                    terminated).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To iterate through an array in WALL, a user needs to begin at
                    the first address of the array (usually pointed to by a label,
                    in this case, the label "Head"), and then increment their way
                    through the addresses of the array (like they would through the
                    indices of an array in a High-Level Language).
                </li>
            </ol>
